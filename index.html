                My name is Spencer Purcell, and I am currently learning coding for the first time.
                I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon and have lived here ever since,
                attending Portland State University for undergrad, for which i studied Biology.
                However, more now I feel like switching gears and trying something a bit new, like programming,
                might be a great opportunity for me. I've always had an interest in computers, and that became very apparent in the middle of college for me,
                but I feel like I'm in the dark about a lot that goes on with websites, with databases, etc.
                </p>

                Just in the first few weeks of class, I've already noticed how diverse and creative you
                can potentially be with coding and depending on back-end versus front-end development,
                there is a further opportunity to diversify. Something for everyone so to speak. I was fairly
                apprehensive starting this program, but in short order I have come to enjoy the content of this bootcamp,
                now to see how far that optimism goes..
